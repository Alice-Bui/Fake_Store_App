#Fake Store

#“Fake Store” is a project created as part of Assignment 2 for course 3701ICT Mobile Application Development in Griffith University, focusing on developing an interactive and stateful mobile application for an imitation of a shopping platform. The “Fake Store” app’s data is based on a Fake Store API to display products and manage user shopping activities.  Within a mobile environment, users will enjoy a streamlined shopping journey, from exploring products to finalizing purchases, replicating a real shopping experience.


The key functionalities of the application are as follows:

•	Product browsing: accessing a diverse range of categories and products.

•	Cart management: managing the user’s selection, including adding and deleting items in their cart.

•	Order processing: making and completing purchases.
